📊 What are our headline KPIs (total Revenue, total Units, total Transactions, ATV)
✅ Executive Insight Summary
The business generated £4.72M in total revenue from 200k transactions, selling over 600k units. With an average transaction value of £23.59, performance is driven by high transaction volume, highlighting opportunities to grow revenue through ATV optimisation and customer retention strategies.

📊 Which products generate the most revenue (Top 10)?
✅ Executive Insight Summary
The top 10 products generate highly comparable revenue levels, driven primarily by consistent sales volume rather than extreme price differences. This indicates a well-balanced product portfolio with stable demand across multiple SKUs, reducing dependency on a single product and creating opportunities for targeted pricing and promotional optimisation.

📊 Which categories contribute most to total revenue?
✅ Executive Insight Summary
Revenue is evenly distributed across four major categories, with Household leading at 31.78%. The balanced contribution across categories reduces risk and provides multiple levers for revenue growth through pricing, promotion, and cross-category strategies.

🔝Which stores are the 10 top performers by revenue?
✅ Executive Insight Summary
The top 10 stores generate highly comparable revenue levels, suggesting strong operational consistency across locations. This presents an opportunity to use high-performing stores as benchmarks to uplift underperforming locations through targeted operational improvements.

📉Which stores are the 10 bottom performers by revenue?
✅ Executive Insight Summary
The bottom 10 stores underperform by a relatively small revenue margin, suggesting improvement opportunities rather than structural failure. Targeted operational and promotional interventions could materially improve store-level performance.

📈What is the monthly revenue trend over time?

✅ Executive Insight Summary
Monthly revenue remains stable between £183k and £206k with clear seasonal patterns, peaking in mid-year and softening early in the year. The absence of strong growth or decline suggests a mature, operationally stable business with opportunities for targeted revenue optimisation rather than volume expansion.

📉What is Month-over-Month (MoM) revenue growth?

✅ Executive Insight Summary
Month-over-month revenue growth shows normal retail volatility with recurring seasonal dips in February and recoveries in subsequent months. Overall, revenue remains stable, indicating consistent demand rather than structural growth or decline.

📊What is Year-over-Year (YoY) revenue growth?

✅ Executive Insight Summary
Year-over-year revenue growth in 2024 remains modest and stable, fluctuating within a narrow band. This indicates a mature business with consistent demand, where future growth will depend on operational and value-based optimisation rather than market expansion.

📅What is the yearly revenue trend over time?
✅ Executive Insight Summary
Yearly revenue increased marginally from £2.36M in 2023 to £2.36M in 2024, reflecting a stable but mature business with limited organic growth. Future revenue gains will depend on efficiency improvements and value optimisation rather than volume expansion.

🏙️Which city are underperforming relative to others?
✅ Executive Insight Summary
London and Manchester underperform relative to other cities due to significantly lower transaction volumes, despite having competitive or higher average transaction values. This suggests demand generation and market coverage—not pricing—are the primary levers for improvement.

💸Which products have high volume but low revenue (pricing or discount issue)?
✅ Executive Insight Summary
Several high-volume products generate disproportionately low revenue due to very low net unit prices, indicating potential over-discounting or mispricing. Targeted pricing optimisation on these products presents a clear opportunity to improve revenue without sacrificing demand.

🎯Are promotions actually improving performance (promo vs no promo)?
✅ Executive Insight Summary
Promotional sales account for 100% of observed revenue, units, and transactions in the dataset. Due to the absence of non-promotional sales data, the incremental impact of promotions cannot be evaluated. A promo vs non-promo comparison would require a clear control group to assess true promotional uplift.
